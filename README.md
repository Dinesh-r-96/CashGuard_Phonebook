The primary objective of the "CashGuard Phonebook" application is to eliminate confusion when searching for contacts. Creating a contact in our phonebook may seem straightforward, but it can become confusing when multiple individuals share the same name but have different contact details. To address this issue, we have enhanced the conventional phonebook by introducing additional fields, such as Name, Nickname, Number1, Number2, Email ID, Address, and categorizations like Friend, Family, Work, and Relative. This smart phonebook application proves invaluable for users managing extensive contact lists.

Scope of the Project:

The "CashGuard Phonebook" application manages personal contact information, including phone numbers, addresses, and optionally, email IDs. Access to this information is restricted to the phone user. While users may have numerous contacts, they can organize them into groups using this Android project. Its intelligent filtering system enables importing contacts from social networking sites and automatically populating the corresponding fields.

Project Description:

This project focuses on storing personal information, primarily names and phone numbers, but it also supports storing additional details. This feature is particularly beneficial for comprehensive contact management.

The structured database facilitates efficient retrieval, updates, and deletion of stored information directly through user commands. Unlike desktop applications, mobile applications like ours do not require separate database installation; databases are dynamically created as needed during runtime.

Requirements:

Software:

Operating System: Windows or Android
Technology: Android
Frontend: Java SE
Backend: SQLite
Tools: Android Studio or Android SDK
Hardware:

Processor: Snapdragon 410 and above
RAM: 1.0 GB - 2.0 GB
Hard Disk: 2 GB
Limitations:

The system is compatible with all Android models and platforms.
Advanced authorization techniques are not implemented.
The application does not operate in an online mode.
Conclusion:

Users with extensive contact lists will find the "CashGuard Phonebook" application indispensable. It effectively organizes contacts into distinct categories, alleviating confusion caused by similar names across different groups.
